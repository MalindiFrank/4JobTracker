# Job Application Tracker

This is a simple job application tracker built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows you to keep track of your job applications, including the company, role, status, and date applied.

## Features

*   **Add, Edit, and Delete Job Applications**: Easily manage your job applications with full CRUD functionality.
*   **Search and Filter**: Quickly find specific applications by searching for a company or role, or by filtering by application status.
*   **Sort by Date**: Sort your applications by the date you applied, in either ascending or descending order.
*   **Mock API**: The application uses a mock API powered by `json-server` to simulate a real backend.
*   **Protected Routes**: The application includes a basic authentication system that protects the main pages from unauthorized access.
